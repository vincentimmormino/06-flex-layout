# 06-flex-layout
This project was quite fun, because I got to use flex to create the
layout for an entire webpage! I'm starting to get the hang of nested
flex containers. This one was relatively smooth sailing, but I did
struggle a bit to get the footer positioned properly. Setting the
flex container's height to 100% did the trick. It's been a few days
since I initially read The Odin Project's lesson on flex, so I had
forgotten that I have to declare the height when using
flex-direction: column since divs and such don't have an inherent
height the way they do width. Won't automatically fill to the entire
height unless you tell it too. But I remembered!
